### My True Story

So lets begin with the most obvious question WHO IS ARMSTRONG J. LAZENBY?
My Story, My Evolution & My Impressive Credentials - Ph.D in Failure

# Childhood

As a child I was antisocial, finding it difficult to get along with fellow sports teammates. From my fascination of ‘going fast’, I got into Inline Speed Skating at 10 years of age, curtesy of my father.

I pursued that sport and won almost every race at State level. My brother and father also joined the sport, and as a family we were at the top of state level, and competitively finish highly at Nationals.

I began strength training to compliment my Skating at age 11. I remember my first strength coach Desly Hill, now the Aus Olympic Long Track Speed Skating coach, giving me a program of 10kg barbell back squats for 40 reps. That was pretty tough for my 11 year old legs. At this age I wasn’t actually too fit, rather I relied on strength and technique to win races.

Age 13.5: I had won a National title by this point, and this is when we began Ice Skating, for one fact that it’s in the Olympics. I was training on ice, and on wheels, 9 times a week (skating and gym combined).

#Teen Years

In High School I had very few friends. I moved High Schools twice, ending up at a Distance Education School (home school) to complete year 12 over 2 years. I didn’t do year 12 exams to finish school because I was going to be competing at a World Cup event in Russia. I found High School really tough and quite painful for reasons stated soon below. I moved to a school closer the Melbourne City where I would train 6 mornings a week with the Australian National Short Track Speed Skating Team. From the ages of 15–19 I was travelling with the Australian team to 5–6 countries a year for World Cup events and training camps.

My first Ice coach was Ann Zhang - she was one of the longest standing National Coaches of any sport in Australian History. She was also Steven Bradbury’s coach. I met Steve when I was 16, he’s a great guy, and we’ve been friends ever since. He would give me technique help, and was also a source of motivation.

# The Korean Training Camp

Ann took the team on heaps of trips, one of which was a yearly training camp in South Korea for 3 weeks. I really liked Korea, for it’s city and nice people. The training was too much. It started as 2 hours of intense skating on the ice from 6–8am. This required a 20min running and jumping warm up beforehand. It’s impossible to describe with words how intense this training was. All of the training we did in Korea was this nature. Our team of 6 guys skated with Koreans who had better technique, strength, and fitness than all of us. I remember before the morning training, I would wake up 20min before we had to leave and eat a Korean style of Corn Flakes in milk with honey. After the morning training, we would walk back to the hotel and eat again. I didn’t have a protein shake after training (which I should have), but back then I was doing everything wrong, training and nutrition wise anyway. For lunch we made sandwiches in the hotel, though sometimes we would eat out. For those times, I had this delicious schnitzel with a sweet sauce, and a small amount of white rice. Looking back, I can’t believe how I was functioning on such a low amount of food, exercising this hard. During the day In the hotel I play League of Legends for an hour or two (an online computer game that’s good), possibly sleep for half an hour, muck around, and get ready for the afternoon session. My daily life in Korea wasn’t much at all; the team sometimes play an addictive app together or just lied around in the hotel.

Afternoon training part 1: We were to arrive at the running stadium by 4pm. And let me mention that its summer in Korea, and by this time, we are in direct sunlight and at least 30 degree heat. I would bring 2 drink bottles, a 2 litre Gatorade and a 2 litre water. The first part of the afternoon session went from 4–5:40pm. We call it off ice training, because it consists of jumps, technique, and ice positions on the land. The Korean coach always made us do 5 laps of running on the very outer lane of the 400m running track. This probably took 15 minutes. This alone wasn’t easy. We then went on to do 15 minutes of bodyweight squats (no lockout of the knees at the top, full depth, fast tempo, skating position). This is stupidly hard. We did that run and squats, 5 afternoons a week. That was the beginning of the off ice session, as we proceeded to do turn belt exercises, one leg squats, interval runs, and stadium stair runs. I remember one session where he made us do 40 minutes of running up and down all the stairs in the stadium, 1 step at a time. This session was super hard. We finished at 5:30–5:45, then walked right over to the ice rink.

Afternoon training part 2: Our ice session went from 6–8pm. Again, this was very intense. This was mainly laps and laps, relay, some technique skating, but mostly endless laps to slaughter the legs. We finished up here late, and every time the coach made us do 5 laps running around the outside of the rink to cool down. Even though it wasn’t fast, it was still hard because of how much burn the legs had accumulated over the past 4 hours of afternoon training. Sometimes we would even do plyometric (jump training) at 8pm, then the cool down. I would get back to the hotel, get changed, and go out for dinner, which was usually Korean BBQ.

That’s one day of the Korean training camp. We did this schedule 5 days a week, for 3 weeks. On Saturdays we would just did the morning training. Looking back on it now, I would never do it again. The amount of damage to my health that did is extraordinary. People who don’t exercise would have a better biochemistry profile than me at this point. I also didn’t talk much about eating, because I really did very little. I was super malnourished, which is incredibly bad for you.

Ps. The rest of my story I still need to write out over the next few days - this is incomplete
